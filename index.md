## About Me

I've spent 8+ years building infrastructure across defense (BAE Systems), finance (GFT), and automotive (Keyloop). Currently a DevOps Technical Lead.

I built a platform on AWS EKS that 30+ teams now use for autonomous deployments. Before that, I migrated hundreds of repos and CI/CD pipelines from Bitbucket to GitHub. Every role was the same job underneath: take broken infrastructure and make it work for people.

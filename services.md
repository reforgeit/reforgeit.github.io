I fix infrastructure that's slowing your team down and build the systems that let you ship faster.

## Infrastructure Audit

I review your cloud and DevOps setup. I find the problems and the waste, then give you a concrete plan to fix it.

**What you get:**
- Architecture diagram of your current state
- Written findings with severity ratings
- Prioritized recommendations roadmap
- Walkthrough session with your team

**Timeline:** 1–2 weeks

## Implementation

I build infrastructure, pipelines, and platforms. I've done this at scale: a company-wide platform serving 30+ teams, a migration of hundreds of repos, production Kubernetes clusters handling real traffic.

**Example projects:**
- Kubernetes cluster setup and optimization
- CI/CD pipeline design (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD)
- Infrastructure as Code rollout (Terraform)
- Monitoring and observability (NewRelic, ELK)
- Internal Developer Platform development

**Timeline:** 1–3 months, depending on scope

## Advisory & Retainer

Ongoing access to a senior DevOps engineer who knows your stack. I review architecture decisions, debug production issues alongside your team, and help your engineers handle it themselves next time.

**What's included:**
- Architecture reviews and technical guidance
- On-call support when deployments break
- Pair sessions with your engineers
- Shared modules, templates, and documentation

**Timeline:** Monthly engagement

I fix infrastructure that's slowing your team down and build the systems that let you move faster.

---

## Infrastructure Audit

I review your cloud and DevOps setup, find what's broken or risky, and tell you how to fix it.

**Deliverables:**
- Architecture diagram of current state
- Written findings with severity ratings
- Prioritized recommendations roadmap
- Presentation and walkthrough session

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

---

## Implementation

Hands-on building of infrastructure, pipelines, and platforms. I've done this at scale: a company-wide GitHub migration and 30+ teams onboarded to a unified platform.

**Example Projects:**
- Kubernetes cluster setup and optimization
- CI/CD pipeline design and implementation
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) rollout
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Internal Developer Platform development

**Timeline:** Project-dependent, typically 1-3 months

## Advisory & Retainer

Ongoing access for guidance, support, and someone who picks up when things break. I've supported teams across multiple organizations and know how to help without taking over.

**Includes:**
- Architecture reviews and tech decisions
- On-call support when deployments go sideways
- Team mentoring (I'll pair with your engineers)
- Shared modules, templates, and documentation

**Timeline:** Monthly engagement

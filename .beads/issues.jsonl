{"id":"reforgeit-pages-site-0en","title":"Create project directory structure","description":"# Task: Create Project Directory Structure\n\n## What\nCreate the complete directory scaffolding for the Jekyll site as specified in PLAN.md.\n\n## Why\nJekyll has strict conventions about directory naming. The underscore-prefixed directories have special meaning:\n- `_layouts/` - Page templates (default, page, post)\n- `_includes/` - Reusable HTML partials (header, footer)\n- `_posts/` - Blog posts (date-prefixed markdown files)\n- `_data/` - Structured data files (YAML/JSON, like navigation)\n- `assets/` - Static files (CSS, images, PDFs)\n\n## Directory Tree to Create\n```\n_data/\n_layouts/\n_includes/\n_posts/\nassets/\nassets/css/\nassets/images/\nassets/files/\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- All directories should be empty initially (files added by subsequent tasks)\n- Git doesn't track empty directories, so either:\n  - Add a .gitkeep to each, OR\n  - Create the directories when adding files (preferred)\n- The `_posts/` directory starts empty intentionally (blog content is post-MVP)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All directories exist\n- [ ] Directory names match Jekyll conventions exactly\n- [ ] No typos in underscore prefixes\n\n## Parent Epic\n[EPIC] Project Foundation \u0026 Jekyll Setup\n\n## Blocks\n- All layout and include creation tasks\n- All page creation tasks\n- All asset creation tasks","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"mc.reforgeit@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-13T13:29:02.528324065+01:00","created_by":"reforgeit","updated_at":"2026-01-13T13:29:02.528324065+01:00"}
{"id":"reforgeit-pages-site-ced","title":"[EPIC] Project Foundation \u0026 Jekyll Setup","description":"# Epic: Project Foundation \u0026 Jekyll Setup\n\n## Overview\nThis epic covers the foundational setup required before any other work can begin. It establishes the directory structure, dependency management, and core configuration that all other components depend on.\n\n## Strategic Importance\n- **Blocking Status**: This is P0 (critical) because EVERY other task depends on the project being properly initialized\n- **Risk Mitigation**: Getting config right first prevents cascading issues later\n- **Developer Experience**: Proper setup enables local development workflow from day one\n\n## Background \u0026 Context\nWe're building a Jekyll static site for GitHub Pages. Jekyll requires specific directory conventions:\n- `_` prefixed directories have special meaning (_layouts, _includes, _posts, _data)\n- Gemfile defines Ruby dependencies including Jekyll version and plugins\n- _config.yml is the central nervous system of the site\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] All required directories exist with correct naming\n- [ ] Gemfile installs without errors\n- [ ] `bundle exec jekyll serve` runs successfully\n- [ ] Site loads at localhost:4000\n- [ ] No Jekyll warnings about missing files\n\n## Technical Decisions\n1. **Jekyll 4.3**: Latest stable, GitHub Pages compatible\n2. **Minima 2.5**: Default theme, minimal customization needed\n3. **Three plugins**: feed, seo-tag, sitemap (all GitHub Pages whitelisted)\n\n## Dependencies\nNone - this is the root of the dependency tree.\n\n## Subtasks (see linked issues)\n1. Create directory structure\n2. Create and configure Gemfile\n3. Create _config.yml with site metadata\n4. Create navigation data file\n5. Create robots.txt\n6. Verify local development server works","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"mc.reforgeit@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-13T13:28:22.85093599+01:00","created_by":"reforgeit","updated_at":"2026-01-13T13:28:22.85093599+01:00"}

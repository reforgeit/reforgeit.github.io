It establishes the directory structure, dependency management, and core configuration that all other components depend on.\n\n## Strategic Importance\n- **Blocking Status**: This is P0 (critical) because EVERY other task depends on the project being properly initialized\n- **Risk Mitigation**: Getting config right first prevents cascading issues later\n- **Developer Experience**: Proper setup enables local development workflow from day one\n\n## Background \u0026 Context\nWe're building a Jekyll static site for GitHub Pages. Jekyll requires specific directory conventions:\n- `_` prefixed directories have special meaning (_layouts, _includes, _posts, _data)\n- Gemfile defines Ruby dependencies including Jekyll version and plugins\n- _config.yml is the central nervous system of the site\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] All required directories exist with correct naming\n- [ ] Gemfile installs without errors\n- [ ] `bundle exec jekyll serve` runs successfully\n- [ ] Site loads at localhost:4000\n- [ ] No Jekyll warnings about missing files\n\n## Technical Decisions\n1. **Jekyll 4.3**: Latest stable, GitHub Pages compatible\n2. **Minima 2.5**: Default theme, minimal customization needed\n3. **Three plugins**: feed, seo-tag, sitemap (all GitHub Pages whitelisted)\n\n## Dependencies\nNone - this is the root of the dependency tree.\n\n## Subtasks (see linked issues)\n1. Create directory structure\n2. Create and configure Gemfile\n3. Create _config.yml with site metadata\n4. Create navigation data file\n5. Create robots.txt\n6. Verify local development server works","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"mc.reforgeit@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-13T13:28:22.85093599+01:00","created_by":"reforgeit","updated_at":"2026-01-13T13:28:22.85093599+01:00"}

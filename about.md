I'm Milosz Czajkowski, a DevOps Technical Lead at Keyloop (remotely). I build internal developer platforms and fix the infrastructure problems that slow teams down.

## Background

Mathematics degree from Adam Mickiewicz University, then consulting, then DevOps. The math background means I'm comfortable with complexity, yet I prefer eliminating it.

## How I Work

- **With your team** — I pair with your engineers, not disappear into a silo
- **Documentation-first** — If it's not written down, it didn't happen
- **Keep it simple** — I'd rather delete code than add abstractions
- **Async-friendly** — Remote work across timezones is my default

## Credentials

**Certifications:**
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate

**Education:**
- MSc Mathematics, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan
- BSc Mathematics, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan

## Technical Skills

AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Helm, Docker, Python, Bash, NewRelic, Backstage

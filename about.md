I'm Milosz Czajkowski, a DevOps Technical Lead working remotely from Poznan, Poland. I design internal developer platforms and fix the infrastructure nobody wants to touch.

## Background

Mathematics degree from Adam Mickiewicz University (BSc and MSc). The math background means I'm wired to simplify. I look for what can be removed, not what can be added.

I started in defense tech at BAE Systems, maintaining CI/CD for enterprise systems. Moved to GFT building cloud infrastructure for financial services. At Keyloop, I went from DevOps Engineer to Technical Lead, designing the internal developer platform that became the company standard.

## How I Work

- **With your team** -- I work alongside your engineers, not in a silo
- **Documentation-first** -- if it's not written down, it didn't happen
- **Less is more** -- I'd rather delete code than add abstractions
- **Async-native** -- remote work across timezones is my default mode

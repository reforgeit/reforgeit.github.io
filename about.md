I'm Milosz Czajkowski, a DevOps Technical Lead working remotely. I build internal developer platforms and fix the infrastructure problems that slow teams down.

## Background

Mathematics degree from Adam Mickiewicz University, then consulting, then DevOps. The math background means I'm comfortable with complexity, yet I prefer eliminating it.

## How I Work

- **With your team** — I pair with your engineers, not disappear into a silo
- **Documentation-first** — If it's not written down, it didn't happen
- **Keep it simple** — I'd rather delete code than add abstractions
- **Async-friendly** — Remote work across timezones is my default

## Selected Work

- **Internal Developer Platform** — Designed and built a platform on AWS EKS with ArgoCD, Terraform, and Backstage. Now used across the organization for consistent, autonomous deployments.
- **GitHub Migration** — Migrated hundreds of repos and pipelines from Bitbucket/Bamboo to GitHub. Built shared GitHub Actions templates and a self-service migration tool so teams could move at their own pace.
- **EKS Operations** — Maintained multiple production EKS clusters: upgrades, Karpenter tuning, ALB/external-DNS controllers, WAF troubleshooting. Kept things stable while the platform scaled.
- **IaC & Observability** — Built Terraform and Helm-based infrastructure for AWS and Kubernetes. Set up and maintained an ELK stack for centralized logging that made debugging production issues straightforward.
- **Team Enablement** — I build platforms and help teams use them. Documentation, consultations, shared modules, and jumping on calls when deployments go sideways. Teams adopted better patterns because someone showed up and helped.
